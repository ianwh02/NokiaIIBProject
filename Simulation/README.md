# Simulation Code

This folder contains all of the simulation code. The final version of the code is under the name 'pp_throughput_withCSIwithHARQwithsubarray.m', which requires all of the MATLAB helper functions in the same directory. 'plotPerformanceMetrics.m' is used to take the data in the /results/ dir and plot figures.
